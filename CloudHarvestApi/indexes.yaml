# Documentation for `indexes.yaml`
#
# This file is used to define the indexes for the MongoDB collections used in the CloudHarvest API.
# The structure of the file is as follows:
#
# - The root level of the file contains the names of the MongoDB databases. In the provided example, there is one database named `harvest`.
# - The first nested level under each database name contains the names of the collections. In the provided example, there are collections named `api_nodes`, `pstar`, and `meta`.
# - Each collection has a list of fields that should be indexed. These are listed under the collection name.
#     - For simple binary tree indexes, the field name is listed as a string.
#     - For compound indexes or indexes with additional options, the field names and options are listed as a dictionary.
#     - The `keys` field in the dictionary is used to specify the fields that should be included in the index.
#     - The `options` field in the dictionary is used to specify additional options for the index, such as whether the index should enforce uniqueness (`unique: true`).


harvest:              # The database name
  api_nodes:          # The collection name
    - hostname        # A simple binary tree index on the `hostname` field
    - end             # A simple binary tree index on the `end` field
  pstar:              # Another collection
