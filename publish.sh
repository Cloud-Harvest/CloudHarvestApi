# publish.sh
# This script is used to build, test, and publish a Docker image for the Cloud Harvest API.
# It fetches the version number from meta.json and uses it along with the git commit's short name to tag the Docker image.
# The script also checks that all commits have been pushed to git and that the current branch is main.
#
# Note: This script requires Docker, git, and grep to be installed and properly configured on the system where it will be run.
